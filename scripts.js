/**
 * Data Catalog Project Starter Code - SEA Stage 2
 *
 * This file is where you should be doing most of your work. You should
 * also make changes to the HTML and CSS files, but we want you to prioritize
 * demonstrating your understanding of data structures, and you'll do that
 * with the JavaScript code you write in this file.
 * 
 * The comments in this file are only to help you learn how the starter code
 * works. The instructions for the project are in the README. That said, here
 * are the three things you should do first to learn about the starter code:
 * - 1 - Change something small in index.html or style.css, then reload your 
 *    browser and make sure you can see that change. 
 * - 2 - On your browser, right click anywhere on the page and select
 *    "Inspect" to open the browser developer tools. Then, go to the "console"
 *    tab in the new window that opened up. This console is where you will see
 *    JavaScript errors and logs, which is extremely helpful for debugging.
 *    (These instructions assume you're using Chrome, opening developer tools
 *    may be different on other browsers. We suggest using Chrome.)
 * - 3 - Add another string to the titles array a few lines down. Reload your
 *    browser and observe what happens. You should see a fourth "card" appear
 *    with the string you added to the array, but a broken image.
 *
